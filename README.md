# Flutter Contact List App

This is a simple Flutter application that allows users to add contacts with a name and phone number. The contacts are displayed in a list, and users can delete a contact by long-pressing on the list item, which triggers a confirmation dialog.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Users can input a name and phone number in the respective fields and add the contact to the list.
- **Display Contacts**: Added contacts are displayed in a list with a `ListTile`.
- **Delete Contact**: Long-press on a contact to delete it. A confirmation dialog will appear to confirm the deletion.
